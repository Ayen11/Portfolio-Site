                <p>
                    I’m Emanuel. I started coding right before covid started at 2020. At first all I made were simple Twitter/Discord/Reddit bots in Python, 
                    but when covid hit I wanted to do something bigger.. So I started making games! 
                    I’ve worked through the 2 years of lockdowns on my first game IDIOTIC (The Game), 
                    and had some success with it. With a small community of 600 users on Reddit and a viral trailer that got to the top 10 posts on Reddit for that day.
                    <br><br>
                    Now I’m mastering new technologies like Unity and Godot and also web development by making web games and websites. 
                    I’ve already published one web game and made *this* website, and I’m looking forward to making more!

                        <li><span>Idiotic the game</span><br>3D movement fps video game solo developed with unreal engine 4-5 and published to steam. 
                            Basically I’ve done everything in that game except for the font, the music and some of the textures. I’ve modelled characters for animations. 
                            Builts pipelines to rig, animate and export them to UE. Programmed the movement, weapons, XP, procedural map generation, Enemy AI systems and more.<br> 
                            Worked with the player base in realtime on how to create better looking environments (I worked, they gave feedback). 
                            Recruited and managed playtesting groups. Did market research and recorded and edited trailers and poster art for the game. 
                            Most viral posts have reached 2.3M views on Gifycat (and 3.4M views on Reddit). This and more was my first ever experience with game development.
